## MAC and IP Address Resolution

### MAC Address

- A unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications at the data link layer.
- Format: 48-bit address, usually written as six groups of two hexadecimal digits separated by colons.

### IP Address
- A numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

### ARP Process in Detail
1. **Device A wants to communicate with Device B** within the same network.
2. **Device A broadcasts an ARP request** to all devices on the local network: "Who has IP address 192.168.1.2? Tell 192.168.1.1."
3. **Device B receives the ARP request** and replies with its MAC address: "192.168.1.2 is at MAC address 00:14:22:01:23:45."
4. **Device A stores the MAC address** in its ARP cache and uses it to send packets directly to Device B.

### Communicating with a Device on a Different Network
1. **Device A wants to communicate with Device B** on a different network.
2. **Device A checks its routing table** and finds the route to the default gateway (router).
3. **Device A sends packets to the router's MAC address**.
4. **The router forwards the packets** to Device B's network, using its routing table to determine the next hop.
5. **Device B receives the packets** and sends responses back to Device A through the router.

### Default Router in Linux
- A default router (or gateway) is the device that routes traffic from a local network to other networks or the internet.
- **Configuring the Default Gateway**:
  ```sh
  sudo ip route add default via <router-ip>
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sh
  sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.1
  ```

## Ethernet Packets and Ethernet Explanation

### What is Ethernet?
Ethernet is a family of wired networking technologies commonly used in local area networks (LANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), and wide area networks (WANs). It defines wiring and signaling standards for the physical layer and data packet formats and protocols for the data link layer of the OSI model.

### Ethernet Frame Structure
An Ethernet frame is a data packet that includes information needed for data link layer transmission. The Ethernet frame format is standardized and consists of several fields:

1. **Preamble**: 7 bytes used to synchronize receiver clock.
2. **Start Frame Delimiter (SFD)**: 1 byte indicating the start of the frame.
3. **Destination MAC Address**: 6 bytes indicating the recipient's MAC address.
4. **Source MAC Address**: 6 bytes indicating the sender's MAC address.
5. **Type/Length**: 2 bytes indicating the type of protocol (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) or the length of the payload.
6. **Payload**: Variable length data (up to 1500 bytes) containing the encapsulated data from higher layers.
7. **Frame Check Sequence (FCS)**: 4 bytes used for error checking.

### Ethernet Frame Format

| Field                 | Size (Bytes) |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| Preamble              | 7            |
| Start Frame Delimiter | 1            |
| Destination MAC       | 6            |
| Source MAC            | 6            |
| Type/Length           | 2            |
| Payload               | 46-1500      |
| Frame Check Sequence  | 4            |

### Ethernet Operation
Ethernet operates by transmitting data in packets called frames between devices connected via cables. Each device on an Ethernet network has a unique MAC address, which it uses to communicate with other devices.

### Example Ethernet Frame

- **Preamble**: `10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010`
- **SFD**: `10101011`
- **Destination MAC**: `00:14:22:01:23:45`
- **Source MAC**: `00:14:22:01:23:46`
- **Type**: `0800` (IPv4)
- **Payload**: Data from higher layer protocols.
- **FCS**: CRC value for error checking.

### Ethernet Transmission Process
1. **Frame Creation**: The sending device creates an Ethernet frame encapsulating the data to be sent.
2. **Frame Transmission**: The frame is transmitted over the Ethernet cable to the destination device.
3. **Frame Reception**: The receiving device captures the frame and checks the destination MAC address.
4. **Error Checking**: The receiving device uses the FCS to check for errors.
5. **Frame Processing**: If no errors are found, the receiving device processes the payload.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Ethernet
- **Advantages**:
  - High speed and reliability.
  - Widely used and standardized.
  - Cost-effective for LANs.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited range without repeaters or switches.
  - Susceptible to physical damage and interference.

  - To view the routing table: `ip route show`

#### ICMP and ARP
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**: Used for error messages and operational information (e.g., `ping` command).
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: Resolves IP addresses to MAC (hardware) addresses within a local network.

#### Data Transmission in a Network
When a device wants to communicate with another device:

1. **Local Network**:
   - The sender sends an ARP request to get the MAC address of the recipient.
   - If the recipient is in the same network, it responds with its MAC address.
   - Data is then sent directly to the recipient using the MAC address.

2. **Different Network**:
   - The sender sends data to the default gateway (router).
   - The router forwards the data to the next router, and this process continues until the data reaches the recipient’s network.
   - ARP is used within each local network to resolve MAC addresses.

#### ARP and ICMP
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: Resolves IP addresses to MAC (hardware) addresses within a local network. 
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**: Used for error messages and operational information (e.g., `ping` command).

##### Example of ARP
1. **Local Network Communication**:
   - **Sender**: Sends an ARP request to get the MAC address of the recipient.
   - **Recipient**: If in the same network, it responds with its MAC address.
   - **Data Transmission**: Data is sent directly to the recipient using the MAC address.

2. **Different Network Communication**:
   - **Sender**: Sends data to the default gateway (router).
   - **Router**: Forwards the data to the next router, and this process continues until the data reaches the recipient’s network.
   - **ARP**: Used within each local network to resolve MAC addresses.

##### Types of Casts
- **Unicast**: Communication between a single sender and a single receiver.
- **Broadcast**: Communication from one sender to all possible receivers in the network.
- **Multicast**: Communication from one sender to a group of receivers.

#### ARP Packet
- **Purpose**: Determine the MAC address corresponding to an IP address.
- **Process**: 
  - **Sender**: Broadcasts an ARP request asking "Who has IP address X?"
  - **Recipient**: Responds with its MAC address.

## IPv6 Addressing

### IP Address Format
- **IPv6**: 128-bit address, written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).

### IPv6 Features
- **Larger Address Space**: Provides a virtually unlimited number of IP addresses.
- **Simplified Header**: Improves routing efficiency and performance.
- **Auto-Configuration**: Devices can automatically configure their own IP addresses.
- **Integrated Security**: IPsec is mandatory in IPv6.
- **No Broadcasts**: Uses multicast and anycast instead of broadcast.

### Example Address
- `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`

### Subnetting in IPv6
IPv6 uses prefix length to denote subnetting (similar to CIDR in IPv4).

- **Example**:
  - Global Unicast Address: `2001:0db8::/32`
  - Subnet ID: `2001:0db8:abcd::/48`
  - Interface ID: `2001:0db8:abcd:0012:0000:0000:0000:0001/64`

### Transition from IPv4 to IPv6
- **Dual Stack**: Devices run both IPv4 and IPv6.
- **Tunneling**: Encapsulating IPv6 traffic within IPv4 packets.
- **Translation**: Converting IPv6 packets to IPv4 packets and vice versa.

### Practical Usage
- Configure IPv6 on a network interface:
  ```sh
  sudo ip -6 addr add 2001:db8::1/64 dev eth0
  ```
- Add an IPv6 route:
  ```sh
  sudo ip -6 route add 2001:db8:abcd::/64 via 2001:db8::1
  ```
  
### Address Types
- **Unicast**: Identifies a single network interface.
- **Multicast**: Identifies multiple network interfaces.
- **Anycast**: Identifies the nearest of multiple network interfaces.

- Common messages: Echo Request (ping), Echo Reply (pong), Destination Unreachable.

### Packet Structure
1. **Type**: 8 bits, indicates the type of message.
2. **Code**: 8 bits, provides further information about the type.
3. **Checksum**: 16 bits, for error-checking.
4. **Rest of the Header**: Varies based on the type and code.

### Example
- **Ping**:
  - Type: 8 (Echo Request)
  - Code: 0

## ARP Packets

### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- Used to map an IP address to a MAC address within a local network.

### ARP Process
1. **ARP Request**: Broadcasted by a device to find the MAC address associated with an IP address.
2. **ARP Reply**: Sent by the device with the requested IP address, containing its MAC address.

### Packet Structure
1. **Hardware Type**: 16 bits, indicates the network type (e.g., Ethernet).
2. **Protocol Type**: 16 bits, indicates the protocol (e.g., IP).
3. **Hardware Address Length**: 8 bits.
4. **Protocol Address Length**: 8 bits.

## VirtIO and Virtual Machines

### VirtIO
VirtIO is a virtualization standard for network and disk device drivers. It provides a generic interface between the guest virtual machine (VM) and the hypervisor, allowing for efficient data exchange. VirtIO drivers are designed to offer near-native performance by reducing the overhead typically associated with emulating hardware.

#### Advantages of VirtIO
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the overhead of emulating hardware devices, resulting in improved performance.
- **Standardization**: Provides a consistent and standardized interface for various types of devices.
- **Compatibility**: Supported by major hypervisors, including KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) and QEMU (Quick Emulator).
- **Scalability**: Suitable for high-performance and scalable virtualized environments.

### VirtIO Network Device (virtio-net)
VirtIO network device (virtio-net) is a paravirtualized network driver that allows VMs to communicate with the host system's network stack. It provides a more efficient interface compared to traditional network emulation, resulting in improved network performance.

#### How VirtIO Emulates the Network Interface Card (NIC)
1. **Initialization**: When a VM starts, the hypervisor initializes the virtio-net device and assigns it to the VM.
2. **Device Discovery**: The guest kernel detects the virtio-net device during boot and loads the appropriate virtio-net driver.
3. **Queue Pairs**: Virtio-net uses a pair of virtqueues (one for transmitting and one for receiving) to handle network packets. Each queue consists of a descriptor ring, available ring, and used ring.
4. **Data Transmission**: 
    - **Guest to Host**: The guest places network packets into the transmit virtqueue. The hypervisor processes these packets and forwards them to the host network stack.
    - **Host to Guest**: The hypervisor places incoming packets into the receive virtqueue. The guest kernel processes these packets and forwards them to the appropriate application.
5. **Efficient I/O**: Virtio-net reduces the need for costly device emulation by directly sharing memory pages between the guest and host. This allows for efficient data transfer and reduces CPU overhead.

#### Key Components of VirtIO-net
- **Virtqueues**: Circular buffer structures used for efficient communication between the guest and host.
- **Descriptor Ring**: Holds descriptors that describe the location and size of network packets in memory.
- **Available Ring**: Indicates which descriptors are available for processing.
- **Used Ring**: Indicates which descriptors have been processed and are ready to be reused.

### Running Virtual Machines with QEMU
QEMU (Quick Emulator) is a popular open-source emulator and virtualization tool that supports VirtIO. QEMU can run VMs with various configurations, including using VirtIO for network and disk devices.

#### Example Command to Run a VM with QEMU and VirtIO
```sh
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel bzImage -m 1G \
  -drive file=rootfs.img,if=virtio \
  -netdev tap,id=net0,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no \
  -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0 \
  -append "root=/dev/vda rw" -daemonize
```

#### Explanation of the Command
- **qemu-system-x86_64**: Invokes the QEMU emulator for x86_64 architecture.
- **-kernel bzImage**: Specifies the kernel image to boot.
- **-m 1G**: Allocates 1 GB of memory to the VM.
- **-drive file=rootfs.img,if=virtio**: Attaches a disk image (`rootfs.img`) as a VirtIO block device.
- **-netdev tap,id=net0,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no**: Configures a TAP network backend for the VM. The TAP device `tap0` is used for network connectivity.
- **-device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0**: Attaches a VirtIO network device (`virtio-net-pci`) to the VM and links it to the `net0` network backend.
- **-append "root=/dev/vda rw"**: Passes kernel parameters to specify the root filesystem and mount it as read-write.
- **-daemonize**: Runs QEMU as a background process.

### Detailed Steps to Set Up VirtIO Network with QEMU

1. **Install QEMU and KVM**:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm qemu-utils
    ```

2. **Create a TAP Device**:
    ```sh
    sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap
    sudo ip link set dev tap0 up
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev tap0
    ```

3. **Create a Bridge Device (Optional)**:
    ```sh
    sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge
    sudo ip link set dev br0 up
    sudo ip link set dev tap0 master br0
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev br0
    ```

4. **Prepare the Disk Image**:
    ```sh
    qemu-img create -f qcow2 rootfs.img 10G
    ```

5. **Run the VM with QEMU**:
    ```sh
    qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel bzImage -m 1G \
      -drive file=rootfs.img,if=virtio \
      -netdev tap,id=net0,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no \
      -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0 \
      -append "root=/dev/vda rw" -daemonize
    ```

### Monitoring and Managing VirtIO Devices

#### Check VirtIO Devices in the Guest
To check the VirtIO devices in the guest VM, use the following commands inside the VM:

- **List all network interfaces**:
    ```sh
    ip link show
    ```

- **Check VirtIO block devices**:
    ```sh
    lsblk
    ```

- **Check loaded VirtIO drivers**:
    ```sh
    lsmod | grep virtio
    ```

### Advanced Configuration and Optimization

#### Enable Multiqueue for VirtIO-net
Multiqueue improves network performance by allowing multiple CPU cores to process network packets simultaneously. To enable multiqueue, use the following QEMU command options:

```sh
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel bzImage -m 1G \
  -drive file=rootfs.img,if=virtio \
  -netdev tap,id=net0,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no,queues=4 \
  -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0,mq=on,vectors=10 \
  -append "root=/dev/vda rw" -daemonize
```

#### Enable Offloading Features
To further optimize network performance, enable offloading features such as checksum offloading and TCP segmentation offloading (TSO):

```sh
ethtool -K eth0 tx off
ethtool -K eth0 tso off
```

#### Configure NUMA for Better Performance
Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) configuration can improve performance for VMs with high memory and CPU usage:

```sh
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel bzImage -m 4G \
  -numa node,memdev=mem0 \
  -object memory-backend-ram,size=4G,id=mem0 \
  -drive file=rootfs.img,if=virtio \
  -netdev tap,id=net0,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no \
  -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0 \
  -append "root=/dev/vda rw" -daemonize
```

By using VirtIO for network and disk devices, you can achieve high-performance virtualization with QEMU and KVM. The efficient interface provided by VirtIO drivers significantly reduces the overhead of device emulation, allowing for near-native performance in virtualized environments.

## Static Routing and Bridging

### Static Routing

Static routing is a type of network routing technique in which routes are manually configured and managed by the network administrator. Unlike dynamic routing, where routes are automatically adjusted by network protocols, static routing requires manual updates whenever the network topology changes. Static routes are useful for small networks or networks with a predictable and stable topology.

#### How Static Routing Works
Static routing involves manually adding routes to the routing table of a router or host. The routing table is a data structure that contains information about the paths that data packets take to reach their destinations. Each entry in the routing table specifies:
- **Destination Network**: The network that the route leads to.
- **Subnet Mask**: Defines the range of IP addresses within the destination network.
- **Next-hop IP Address (Gateway)**: The IP address of the next router that packets should be sent to.

#### Adding a Static Route
To add a static route, you use the `ip route add` command followed by the destination network and the gateway IP address.

- **Command**:
  ```sh
  sudo ip route add <network> via <gateway-ip>
  ```
  **Explanation**:
  - `sudo`: Runs the command with superuser privileges.
  - `ip route add`: Adds a new route to the routing table.
  - `<network>`: Specifies the destination network in CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.2.0/24`).
  - `via <gateway-ip>`: Specifies the IP address of the next-hop router.

- **Example**:
  To add a route to the network `192.168.2.0/24` via the gateway `192.168.1.1`, you would use the following command:
  ```sh
  sudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1
  ```
  This command tells the system that any traffic destined for the `192.168.2.0/24` network should be sent through the gateway `192.168.1.1`.

#### Viewing the Routing Table
To view the current routing table and verify the added routes:
```sh
ip route show
```
**Explanation**:
- `ip route show`: Displays the current routing table, listing all active routes.

#### Deleting a Static Route
To remove a static route from the routing table:
```sh
sudo ip route del <network> via <gateway-ip>
```
**Explanation**:
- `sudo`: Runs the command with superuser privileges.
- `ip route del`: Deletes a route from the routing table.
- `<network> via <gateway-ip>`: Specifies the route to be deleted.

### Bridging

Bridging is a technique used to connect two or more network segments, making them function as a single network. A network bridge forwards traffic between these segments based on MAC addresses, effectively making the separate segments behave as one. This can help extend the network and improve performance without adding routers.

#### How Bridging Works
A bridge operates at the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and connects different network segments by filtering and forwarding traffic based on MAC addresses. By doing so, it reduces the collision domain but maintains the broadcast domain. This is useful in scenarios where you want to extend the network without adding routers.

#### Creating a Network Bridge
To create a bridge, you use the `ip link add` command to create a bridge interface, and the `ip link set` command to bring the bridge interface up.

- **Commands**:
  ```sh
  sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge
  sudo ip link set dev br0 up
  ```

  **Explanation**:
  - `sudo`: Runs the command with superuser privileges.
  - `ip link add name br0 type bridge`: Creates a new bridge device named `br0`.
  - `ip link set dev br0 up`: Activates the bridge device `br0`.

#### Adding Interfaces to the Bridge
Once the bridge is created, you can add network interfaces to it. This is done by using the `ip link set` command to set the network interfaces as members of the bridge.

- **Commands**:
  ```sh
  sudo ip link set dev eth0 master br0
  sudo ip link set dev tap0 master br0
  ```

  **Explanation**:
  - `sudo`: Runs the command with superuser privileges.
  - `ip link set dev eth0 master br0`: Adds the Ethernet interface `eth0` to the bridge `br0`.
  - `ip link set dev tap0 master br0`: Adds the TAP interface `tap0` to the bridge `br0`.

#### Practical Examples

##### Adding a Static Route
```sh
sudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1
```
**Explanation**:
- Adds a static route to the network `192.168.2.0/24`.
- Specifies `192.168.1.1` as the gateway for this route.

##### Creating a Bridge
```sh
sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge
sudo ip link set dev br0 up
```
**Explanation**:
- Creates a bridge interface named `br0`.
- Activates the bridge interface.

##### Adding Interfaces to the Bridge
```sh
sudo ip link set dev eth0 master br0
sudo ip link set dev tap0 master br0
```
**Explanation**:
- Adds the Ethernet interface `eth0` to the bridge `br0`.
- Adds the TAP interface `tap0` to the bridge `br0`.

#### Additional Commands and Configurations

##### View Bridge Details
To view the details of the bridge and its interfaces:
```sh
brctl show
```
**Explanation**:
- `brctl show`: Displays the current bridge configuration and the interfaces attached to each bridge.

##### Remove Interface from Bridge
To remove an interface from a bridge:
```sh
sudo ip link set dev eth0 nomaster
```
**Explanation**:
- `sudo`: Runs the command with superuser privileges.
- `ip link set dev eth0 nomaster`: Removes the Ethernet interface `eth0` from any bridge it is part of.

##### Delete a Bridge
To delete a bridge interface:
```sh
sudo ip link delete br0
```
**Explanation**:
- `sudo`: Runs the command with superuser privileges.
- `ip link delete br0`: Deletes the bridge interface `br0`.

##### Persisting Static Routes and Bridge Configurations
To make static routes and bridge configurations persistent across reboots, you can add them to your network configuration files (e.g., `/etc/network/interfaces` for Debian-based systems, `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br0` for Red Hat-based systems) or use a network management tool like `NetworkManager`.

##### Example for Debian-based Systems
Add the following lines to `/etc/network/interfaces`:

```sh
auto br0
iface br0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.2
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    bridge_ports eth0 tap0

post-up ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1
```

By understanding and utilizing static routing and bridging, network administrators can effectively manage and optimize network traffic, ensuring efficient and reliable communication within and across networks.

### Conclusion

This set of scripts is designed to create and manage virtual machines using QEMU with the Yocto Kirkstone build. The scripts demonstrate how to set up virtual network devices, such as TAP interfaces, and configure network bridges to enable communication between virtual machines. By utilizing these scripts, you can simulate static routing scenarios with two or three devices.

In the case of three devices, one of the virtual machines (`rt2`) acts as a router to route traffic between the other two devices (`h1` and `h2`). This setup is essential for testing and simulating static routing configurations. The router (rt2) ensures that packets are properly forwarded between the isolated networks of `h1` and `h2`.

To enable IP forwarding on the router (rt2), you need to modify the kernel parameter in the `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` file. This can be done by writing `1` to this file to enable routing or `0` to disable it.

#### Enabling IP Forwarding on the Router
To enable routing, execute the following command on the router (`rt2`):
```sh
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

To disable routing, execute the following command:
```sh
echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

These commands are crucial for ensuring that the router can forward packets between the connected networks, facilitating the simulation of static routing in a virtualized environment.

By following these scripts and enabling IP forwarding, you can effectively simulate and test static routing configurations in a virtual environment, providing a valuable tool for network administrators and developers working with virtualized network setups.
