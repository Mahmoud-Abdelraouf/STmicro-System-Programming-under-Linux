# Comprehensive Linux Systems Programming Course Outline

This course offers a thorough exploration into the world of Linux systems programming and kernel architecture. Each module is designed to provide detailed insights into key areas, ensuring a structured learning experience for advanced learners. Below is a breakdown of each section along with their objectives and key topics:

## 1. Introduction to Assembly Language

**Objective:** Demonstrate the portability of the UNIX/Linux interface through the use of assembly system calls in Glibc.

**Key Topics:**
- Basics of assembly language and its importance in low-level programming.
- How system calls are implemented in assembly within the Glibc environment.
- Calling conventions across different processors (e.g., x86, ARM).

## 2. Tutorial on POSIX Threads

**Objective:** Explore the Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL) and relevant kernel implementations.

**Key Topics:**
- Overview of POSIX threads (pthreads) and thread management.
- Detailed walkthrough of thread creation, synchronization, and management in Linux.
- Examination of kernel-level support for threading.

## 3. Signals as a Means of Interprocess Communications

**Objective:** Discuss the role of signals in IPC and related system concepts.

**Key Topics:**
- Fundamentals of UNIX signals and their role in controlling processes.
- Process states, Job Control, and pseudo terminals (PTYs).
- Use cases and limitations of signals in modern IPC.

## 4. Introduction to Kernel Modules

**Objective:** Explore kernel modules and pseudo file systems crucial for system monitoring.

**Key Topics:**
- Concepts and creation of Linux kernel modules.
- Deep dive into `/proc`, `/sys` filesystems and their role in the Linux ecosystem.
- Understanding Cgroup filesystem and its usage in resource management.

## 5. Building Embedded Linux File Systems and Kernel using Yocto Build System

**Objective:** Learn to build customized Linux environments using different build systems.

**Key Topics:**
- Introduction to the Yocto project and its architecture.
- Building a minimal Linux system for embedded devices.
- Comparison with Debian-like file systems built using Bootstrap and Multistrap.

## 6. Kernel Namespaces and Container Software

**Objective:** Examine how Linux namespaces support containerization technologies.

**Key Topics:**
- Overview of Linux namespaces (PID, net, IPC, mount, etc.).
- Practical demonstrations using Docker, Podman, and Systemd-nspawn.
- System calls associated with namespaces management.

## 7. Fundamentals of TCP/IP and Socket Programming

**Objective:** Detailed study of network programming and the Linux network stack.

**Key Topics:**
- TCP/IP fundamentals and socket programming concepts.
- Exploring the Linux kernel network stack.
- Hands-on coding examples in creating network applications.

## Fridays

Special sessions dedicated to fundamental computer science concepts necessary for understanding deeper system-level functionalities.

**Topics Include:**
- Implementation of classes and objects in non-object-oriented languages like C, with parallels drawn in C++, Python, and JavaScript.
- Additional fundamental topics necessary for a rounded understanding of system programming.
